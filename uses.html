              <b>
              Genetic algorithms simulate the process of natural selection which means those species who can adapt to changes in their environment are able to survive and reproduce and go to next generation. In simple words, they simulate “survival of the fittest” among individual of consecutive generation for solving a problem. 
              Each generation consist of a population of individuals and each individual represents a point in search space and possible solution.<br/><br/>        
              The GAs maintains the population of n individuals (chromosome/solutions) along with their fitness scores.The individuals having better fitness scores are given more chance to reproduce than others. The individuals with better fitness scores are selected who mate and produce better offspring by combining chromosomes of parents

              Protein folding occurs in a cellular compartment called the endoplasmic reticulum. This is a vital cellular process because proteins must be correctly folded into specific, three-dimensional shapes in order to function correctly.
               Unfolded or misfolded proteins contribute to the pathology of many diseases.
